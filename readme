This is the package for fast truncated SVD for large-scaled sparse data.

To developers:
    "svds.h" contains the interfaces of svds-C for accurate truncated SVD of sparse matrix and dense matrix.
    
    svds.c: implementations of svds-C. "svds_C" is the C version of svds in Matlab for truncated SVD [1] with default options while and "svds_C_opt" is the version with user's options, these two functions are designed for sparse matrix in CSR format. While, "svds_C_dense" and "svds_C_dense_opt" are designed for dense matrix.
    
    matrix_vector_functions_intel_mkl.c and matrix_vector_functions_intel_mkl_ext.c in MKL_version contain the basic functions for matrix-matrix, matrix-vector and vector-vector operations implemented with MKL and OpenMP. While. matrix_funs.c in OpenBLAS_version contains the the basic functions for matrix-matrix, matrix-vector and vector-vector operations implemented with OpenBLAS and OpenMP.
    
    We prepare test matrix SNAP.dat.
